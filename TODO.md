- nested resources for planets/:id/flights should give only the flights to that planet ...

x add travel time to flight

- serialize: limit nested data shown such as: 
   - origin and destination for a flight should be just ID and maybe name,
   - flight for planet should be just those departing or arriving there - (but actually - which?)

- should there be flight_from and flight_to for planet? (both referring to the class of flight)
   - started but incomplete - continue working in planet model
